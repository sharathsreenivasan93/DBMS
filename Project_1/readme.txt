The application has been implemented in Java, using the Eclipse IDE. The connection to 
the Oracle databases is performed using JDBC drivers. In order to run the code, three 
external JAR files will have to be added to the build path of the package - 
1) ojdbc6.jar
2) mysql-connector-java-5.1.40-bin.jar
3) sqingx-all-1.6.3.jar

All 3 JAR files have been provided as part of the submission. The starting point of the 
application is FirstWindow.java. This page provides the login/signup options, from where 
the entire application is loaded and subsequent windows can be accessed. 
There is no need to execute any other .java file individually.
